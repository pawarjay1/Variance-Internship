# 📝 ToDo App

A simple **ToDo application** built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
This app allows you to **add, complete, and delete tasks**, with all data stored in the browser’s **localStorage**, so your tasks remain even after refreshing the page.

Building this **ToDo App** helped me strengthen my understanding of:
